If you have tried to push forward a SEO campaign for google
in a field that moves quickly, you might find that the Google
Keyword Planner (GPK) might not give you the most comprehensive
set of keywords to select from. In fact, Google itself have 
manifested that over 15% of queries submitted have never been 
seen before by the search engine, and therefore not available 
for the GKP ranking. This project looks to find potential good
keywords based on your landing page, and extrapolate the 
competition the word might have.

## Think of cost
Google ads work by bidding. This means that in order to have a
your campaign to be on top of the list when the keyword has been
engaged, you will need to outbid your competitors for that specific
keyword. This drives the prices of certain words up, while leaving
related, yet potentially useful words out for grabs. This tool
aims to help you reduce the cost of your campaigns while keeping
track of new topics and associated keywords.
