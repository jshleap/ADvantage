networks set adversarial way mean adversarial way work order networks called generator discriminator first gan proposed ian goodfellow work weve seen gans architectural novelty improved performance stability exactly generative adversarial network layman terms generative adversarial network type generative model consisting models model tries generative images real life data looking original real image data fool model model optimizes looking generated images authentic images order fooled generating model literature gans model generating images called generator model ensuring generator produces authentic looking images called discriminator lets try understand gans using detective robber scenario scenario robber acting generator continuously shows counterfeit note money detective acting discriminator point process detective detects note fake rejects money informs robber whats making note fake robber stage takes note detective uses detective generate note note shows detective continues robber succeeds creating note authentic looking fool detective exactly generative adversarial network works generator produces synthetic images continuously optimized receiving signal discriminator distribution synthetic images nearly matches distribution original images single training iteration step gan involves steps first discriminator shown batch real images weights optimized classify images real images real images labelled generate batch fake images using generator show fake images discriminator optimize weights discriminator classify images fake images fake images labelled third step involves training generator generate batch fake images show fake images discriminator optimizing discriminator classify images fake images optimize generator force discriminator classify fakes images real images confused lets break youll easy mentioned earlier first show discriminator batch real images optimize classify real images real let assume real images label simple absolute mean error loss function lets formulate mathematical expression discriminator representing discriminator feed forward neural network convolutional network real image batch real images parameters loss function look like omitted mean simplicity feeding batch real images back propagating loss signal discriminator optimization simply means discriminator sees real images predict value process step label fake images generated generator loss function looks like back propagating loss signal discriminator optimizing weights means discriminator shown fake image predict value label fake image steps train discriminator step attempts train generator show discriminator fakes images generated generator time loss signature step back propagate loss signal way discriminator generator optimize weights generator loss signal synonymous discriminator informing generator changes needs order generate fake image cause discriminator classify real bring project liferun gradientyou
